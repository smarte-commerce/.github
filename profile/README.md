### Spring Cloud Components

Our platform utilizes the following Spring Cloud components:

1. **Spring Cloud Config**: Centralized configuration management for all microservices, backed by a Git repository. Enables dynamic configuration updates without service restarts.

2. **Netflix Eureka**: Service discovery and registration, allowing services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded URLs.

3. **Spring Cloud Gateway**: API gateway that routes requests to appropriate services, handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and circuit breaking.

4. **Resilience4j**: Fault tolerance library that implements circuit breaker, rate limiter, retry, and bulkhead patterns to improve system resilience.

5. **Spring Cloud Bus**: Event bus that enables configuration changes to propagate to all services in real-time.

6. **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**: Client-side load balancing for service-to-service communication.

7. **Spring Cloud Stream**: Framework for building event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

### Integration with Core Services
